#Intro: The data for this assignment comes from the Seattle Public Library. I am using smaller data sets based on the
#initial 40 million entries to create a report about library circulation trends.

#Summary: The checkout data from the Seattle Public Library provides information on the number of times items were checked out from the
#library's collection, including books, DVDs, and other materials, from 2005 to 2020. This data can be used to identify
#trends in reading and media consumption over time, as well as to inform collection development and resource allocation decisions
#by the library. The data is publicly available on the library's website and can be accessed and analyzed by researchers, journalists, and other interested parties.

#Detailed: The checkout data from the Seattle Public Library was collected and published by the library itself. The library makes this data available to the public as part of its commitment to transparency and open data.
#The data is used by a variety of stakeholders, including researchers, journalists, and community organizations, to analyze trends in reading and media consumption, as well as to inform decisions related to collection development and resource allocation.
#One limitation of the data is that it only reflects checkouts from the Seattle Public Library and does not provide information on reading and media consumption outside of the library's collection. Additionally, the data only reflects physical checkouts and does not include information on digital checkouts, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.
#There may also be some errors in the data, such as incorrect or missing information on items, which could affect the accuracy of analyses and conclusions drawn from the data. However, the library makes efforts to ensure the quality of the data, such as by conducting regular audits and making updates and corrections as needed.
